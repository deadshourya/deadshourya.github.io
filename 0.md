The first good look at Google’s open source operating system Fuchsia OS is here. Discovered by Hotfixit, the default GUI of Fuchsia is Armadillo and it’s the default UI for Fuchsia. The interface looks like a card-based system and contains Google Now-like suggestions. Build using Google’s Futter SDK, you can compile the code as and APK and run on your Android OS. 


Last year, we introduced you to Google’s new operating system in works, which is called Fuchsia. It has been a while that it has even got its new logo. If you’re familiar with Fuchsia, you might be knowing that unlike Android and Chrome OS, this open source operating system isn’t based on Linux kernel. You can read more about Fuchsia and Magenta kernel in our dedicated post.

Google describes Fuchsia OS as an operating system for modern phones and computers. Now, in the latest development, it looks like Fuchsia has got an early interface. It features Google’s favorite card-based design and looks very fluid.

A major part of Fuchsia is written with the cross-platform Flutter SDK, a project that produces code that runs on iOS and Android. Hotfixit.net has recently spotted the Fuchsia System UI, which is called Armadillo, according to Ars Technica.
